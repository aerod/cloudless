> Simple & Sweet Weather App

## Intro

Hi!
When I moved far away from home, my mum started checking the weather forecast for me.
Now I want to help more people like my mum, so I decided to create this web app, where you can check the weather and send complete message to your loved ones.

## Simplest Case Study Ever

### UX
My inspiration:
- https://dribbble.com/shots/5958424-Weather-App
- https://dribbble.com/shots/3927304-Fantastic-Weather-App

Gradient is from [Eggradients](https://www.eggradients.com/)
Icons from [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

üîÆ Plans for future:
- toast notification after copying the weather info ‚ò†Ô∏è
- creating more app-like experience
- adding favicon,
- possibility of changing city

### Technical background
I use [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to develop interface with [webpack-simple template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple).

‚è∞ If I had more time, I could:
- use vuex for handling data from API
- create dict for automatic messages and icons
- fix bugs on safari
- add support for older browsers

üîÆ Plans for future:
~~- adding tests with JEST ‚ò†Ô∏è  (This emoji means, that Im ashamed of a lack of tests)~~
- adding scss-lint & eslint ‚ò†Ô∏è
- creating configuration files for production and development (now there are in webpack.config.js)
- converting app to Progressive Web App

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
